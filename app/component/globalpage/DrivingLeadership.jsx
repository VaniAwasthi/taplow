            Diversity is at the heart of our approach. Taplow Sweden was one of
            Sweden's first executive search firms to integrate strategic
            diversity initiatives. We are also a founding member of the Swedish
            Diversity Charter, a European network established to promote
            inclusive hiring.

            In 2010, we became the first company in our industry to undergo a
            diversity certification process, ensuring that every step of our
            internal and external processes meets the highest standards. This
            was achieved through the Global Diversity Certification Foundation
            (GDCF), a recognised leader in diversity certification.
